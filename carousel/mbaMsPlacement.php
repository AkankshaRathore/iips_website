I feel honoured to invite you to this world of professionalism and commitment.

The world progresses ahead with new technologies mushrooming almost everyday. In such a scenario someone should take responsibility to train the young generation in the right direction, so that they are at par with the latest technologies. I take pride in announcing that IIPS is one such institution, which has not only taken the above responsibility but is also handling it proficiently. Our latest batch of young professionals is working hard to be an essential part of this dynamic software industry. The intensive training and the encouraging learning environment of our institute has grilled in them not only an extensive subject knowledge but also a sense of commitment, diligence and the value of hard work.

I am confident that after having an inside glimpse of IIPS through this brochure you would definitely be interested in testing our students by coming for the On-Campus recruitment. Furthermore I would like to express my gratitude towards those companies which have shown confidence in our students and have come in the past years for the On-Campus placements. They have become an eternal part of the lIPS family and have always received much more than their expectations from us.
